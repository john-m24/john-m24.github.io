Ever since Thomas Jefferson declared that all people have the right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,” humanity has worked to realize that promise. More than two centuries later, I think it’s time to reflect:

Do we still know what these rights mean? Have we successfully created a society where everybody has these rights?

## Life

It’s undeniable that we’ve made enormous progress in securing the right to life. Life expectancy has soared. Medical advances have made once-deadly diseases treatable. Most people today live longer, healthier lives than any previous generation.

On this front, we’ve succeeded.

## Liberty

In a 1787 letter to William Stephens Smith, Jefferson famously wrote:

> “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.”
> 

By “tree of liberty,” he meant that freedom is a living thing — one that must be nourished and defended. In his time, that might have meant revolution. Today, the threats are more subtle, but just as real.

I’m not calling for a revolution. But I am asking: **Do we have liberty?**

Consider the average person’s day:

- Wake up and check email, Instagram, TikTok
- Eat breakfast while watching YouTube
- Commute while scrolling or listening to a podcast
- Sit at a corporate job that feels meaningless and you will soon lose to AI (unless you adapt)
- Come home, scroll through some spoon-fed “truth” on Twitter, Instagram, or maybe even CNN or Fox News
    - If you don’t like the news, maybe you choose to watch a Netflix show about a game show where people murder each other for money or half-plastic people gossip about nothing
- Go to bed, scroll a bit more and fall asleep

**Is this liberty?**

One night, I asked someone close to me to try going 30 minutes before bed without using social media. They would just have to tell me if they ended up using it — no judgment if they did.

- Twenty minutes in: “I haven’t opened anything.”
- Five minutes later: “I opened Facebook.”

This is **not** liberty. It’s compulsion.

If this story resonates with you, you’re not alone. Powerful systems have taken more and more of our time, attention, and autonomy — and we haven’t done enough to stop them.

Jefferson warned us this would happen and it’s up to us to do something about it.

## The Pursuit of Happiness

You can’t pursue anything — let alone happiness — without liberty. And if our freedoms have eroded, so has our capacity to live meaningful lives.

If we truly believe in the pursuit of happiness as a right, it’s time to stop pretending we’re on track — and start taking that right seriously.

## A Call to Action

In *The Spirit of the Laws* (1748), Montesquieu proposed a system to prevent concentrated power: divide it among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This became the foundation for the U.S. system of checks and balances, later emphasized by James Madison in *Federalist No. 51*:

> “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”
> 

That principle shouldn’t just apply to government — it should apply to all powerful entities including corporations, universities and the individual.

But the problem is that **the individual is no longer counterbalancing these systems.**

In 2025, governments, companies, universities, and other institutions are competing for power in full view.

And the average individual? **Scrolling.**

These institutions have done a brilliant job making us feel small, passive, and powerless. But we’re not. 

It’s time we remember that.

## Why We Need To Take Action Now

AI, specifically the LLM, has already proven itself as an extremely capable technology. It’s not going away. It’s only going to get better. Instead of fearing it, we need to learn how to wield it to empower ourselves.

- The plumber who wants to code can learn 10x faster with a highly personalized AI tutor.
- The politically engaged but time-starved individual can use AI to quickly draft letters to representatives, summarize or study bills, and take action.
- The artist, the activist, the builder — all now have a partner that scales their reach.

Whether we do this or not, governments and companies are already using it to empower themselves. AI, used wisely, is a tool for liberation. The individual can’t afford to miss this wave of technology.

We’ve allowed big tech companies to control our time and attention. We need to leverage this technology to reclaim our time, our goals, and our power.

## Where to Begin

Do yourself a favor and **delete the distractions** in your life to make it easier for yourself to take the first step. You may ask, what’s a distraction?

By definition (Oxford Languages), a distraction is “a thing that prevents someone from giving full attention to something else.**”** In this context, it’s something that is preventing you from giving your full attention towards achieving your goals. For example, ask yourself if your social media use helps you achieve your goals more than it hurts. It may do **both**, though if it hurts more than it helps, it’s worth considering it a distraction and deleting it. This can be temporary — consider it a **reset**.

Now, think about something you want to do or learn and get started. You don’t need a master plan.

- Ask a friend or mentor to help you take the first step.
- If no one comes to mind, brainstorm ideas with a chatbot.
- And if you still don’t know where to begin, email me — I’ll help.

We are not powerless.

But if we continue acting like we are, our liberty will be taken away from us — scroll by scroll.

## Final Thought

If you want to live a meaningful life — one full of purpose, agency, and joy — then reclaiming your liberty isn’t optional.

It’s the first step.

This is how we take back our freedom.

This is how we pursue happiness.

And this is how we maximize human potential — starting with our own.
