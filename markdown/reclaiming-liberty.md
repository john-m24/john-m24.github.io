# Reclaiming Our Liberty

Ever since Thomas Jefferson declared that all people have the right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,” humanity has worked to realize that promise.  
More than two centuries later, it’s time to ask:  
Do we still know what those rights mean? Are we truly living them out?

## Life

It’s undeniable that we’ve made enormous progress in securing the right to life. Life expectancy has soared. Medical advances have made once-deadly diseases treatable. Most people today live longer, healthier lives than any previous generation.  
On this front, we’ve succeeded.

## Liberty

In a 1787 letter to William Stephens Smith, Jefferson famously wrote:

> “The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.”

By “tree of liberty,” he meant that freedom is a living thing — one that must be nourished and defended. In his time, that might have meant revolution. Today, the threats are more subtle, but just as real.  

I’m not calling for a revolution.  
But I am asking: **Has liberty truly been maintained?**

Consider the average person’s day:

- Wake up and check email, Instagram, TikTok
- Eat breakfast while watching YouTube
- Commute while scrolling or listening to a podcast
- Sit at a corporate job that feels meaningless — and increasingly automated
- Come home, scroll some more, wind down with Netflix
- Fall asleep — phone still in hand

Is this liberty?  

One night, I asked someone close to me to try going 30 minutes before bed without social media. No judgment — just tell me if they broke it.

- Twenty minutes in: “I haven’t opened anything.”
- Five minutes later: “I opened Facebook.”

This is **not** liberty.  
It’s compulsion.

If this story resonates with you, you’re not alone. Powerful systems have taken more and more of our time, attention, and autonomy — and we haven’t done enough to stop them.  

Jefferson warned us this would happen.  
And he was right.

## The Pursuit of Happiness

You can’t pursue anything — let alone happiness — without liberty. And if our freedoms have eroded, so has our capacity to live meaningful lives.

Gen Z now faces:

- Economic uncertainty from automation
- Crushing student debt
- Skyrocketing housing prices
- Deep social isolation from social media and a pandemic

**The result?**  
Gen Z reports the highest levels of loneliness, depression, and anxiety in recorded history.

If we truly believe in the pursuit of happiness as a right, it’s time to stop pretending we’re on track — and start taking that right seriously.

## A Call to Action

In *The Spirit of the Laws* (1748), Montesquieu proposed a system to prevent concentrated power: divide it among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This became the foundation for the U.S. system of checks and balances, later emphasized by James Madison in *Federalist No. 51*:

> “Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”

That principle shouldn’t just apply to government — it should apply to all powerful entities: corporations, universities, and technologies like AI.  

But here’s the problem:  
**The individual is no longer counterbalancing these systems.**

In 2025, governments, companies, universities, and other institutions are competing for power in full view.  
And the average individual?  
Scrolling.

These institutions have done a brilliant job making us feel small, passive, and powerless.  
But we’re not.  
And it’s time we remember that.

## Why AI Can Empower Us — If We Let It

AI, specifically the LLM, has already proven itself as an extremely capable technology. It’s not going away. It’s only going to get better.  

So instead of fearing it, we need to learn how to wield it to empower ourselves.

- The plumber who wants to code can learn 10x faster with AI tutors.
- The politically engaged but time-starved individual can use AI to draft letters, summarize bills, and take action in minutes.
- The artist, the activist, the builder — all now have a partner that scales their reach.

Whether we do this or not, governments and companies are already using it to empower themselves. AI, used wisely, is a tool for liberation. The individual can’t afford to miss this wave of technology.  

We’ve allowed big tech companies to control our time and attention. We need to leverage this technology to reclaim our time, our goals, and our power.

## Where to Begin

You don’t need a master plan. You just need to start.

- Ask a friend or mentor to help you take the first step.
- If no one comes to mind, brainstorm ideas with a chatbot.
- And if you still don’t know where to begin, email me — I’ll help.

We are not powerless.  
But if we act like we are, we’re giving our liberty away — scroll by scroll.

## Final Thought

If you want to live a meaningful life — one full of purpose, agency, and joy — then reclaiming your liberty isn’t optional.  
It’s the first step.

This is how we take back our freedom.  
This is how we pursue happiness.  
And this is how we maximize human potential — starting with our own.
