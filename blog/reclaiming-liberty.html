      <p>Ever since Thomas Jefferson declared that all people have the right to “Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness,” humanity has worked to realize that promise.<br>More than two centuries later, it’s time to ask:<br>Do we still know what those rights mean? Are we truly living them out?</p>
<hr>
<h2>Life</h2>
<p>It’s undeniable that we’ve made enormous progress in securing the right to life. Life expectancy has soared. Medical advances have made once-deadly diseases treatable. Most people today live longer, healthier lives than any previous generation.<br>On this front, we’ve succeeded.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Liberty</h2>
<p>In a 1787 letter to William Stephens Smith, Jefferson famously wrote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>By “tree of liberty,” he meant that freedom is a living thing — one that must be nourished and defended. In his time, that might have meant revolution. Today, the threats are more subtle, but just as real.  </p>
<p>I’m not calling for a revolution.<br>But I am asking: <strong>Has liberty truly been maintained?</strong></p>
<p>Consider the average person’s day:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wake up and check email, Instagram, TikTok</li>
<li>Eat breakfast while watching YouTube</li>
<li>Commute while scrolling or listening to a podcast</li>
<li>Sit at a corporate job that feels meaningless — and increasingly automated</li>
<li>Come home, scroll some more, wind down with Netflix</li>
<li>Fall asleep — phone still in hand</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this liberty?  </p>
<p>One night, I asked someone close to me to try going 30 minutes before bed without social media. No judgment — just tell me if they broke it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Twenty minutes in: “I haven’t opened anything.”</li>
<li>Five minutes later: “I opened Facebook.”</li>
</ul>
<p>This is <strong>not</strong> liberty.<br>It’s compulsion.</p>
<p>If this story resonates with you, you’re not alone. Powerful systems have taken more and more of our time, attention, and autonomy — and we haven’t done enough to stop them.  </p>
<p>Jefferson warned us this would happen.<br>And he was right.</p>
<hr>
<h2>The Pursuit of Happiness</h2>
<p>You can’t pursue anything — let alone happiness — without liberty. And if our freedoms have eroded, so has our capacity to live meaningful lives.</p>
<p>Gen Z now faces:</p>
<ul>
<li>Economic uncertainty from automation</li>
<li>Crushing student debt</li>
<li>Skyrocketing housing prices</li>
<li>Deep social isolation from social media and a pandemic</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The result?</strong><br>Gen Z reports the highest levels of loneliness, depression, and anxiety in recorded history.</p>
<p>If we truly believe in the pursuit of happiness as a right, it’s time to stop pretending we’re on track — and start taking that right seriously.</p>
<hr>
<h2>A Call to Action</h2>
<p>In <em>The Spirit of the Laws</em> (1748), Montesquieu proposed a system to prevent concentrated power: divide it among the legislative, executive, and judicial branches. This became the foundation for the U.S. system of checks and balances, later emphasized by James Madison in <em>Federalist No. 51</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Ambition must be made to counteract ambition.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That principle shouldn’t just apply to government — it should apply to all powerful entities: corporations, universities, and technologies like AI.  </p>
<p>But here’s the problem:<br><strong>The individual is no longer counterbalancing these systems.</strong></p>
<p>In 2025, governments, companies, universities, and other institutions are competing for power in full view.<br>And the average individual?<br>Scrolling.</p>
<p>These institutions have done a brilliant job making us feel small, passive, and powerless.<br>But we’re not.<br>And it’s time we remember that.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Why AI Can Empower Us — If We Let It</h2>
<p>AI, specifically the LLM, has already proven itself as an extremely capable technology. It’s not going away. It’s only going to get better.  </p>
<p>So instead of fearing it, we need to learn how to wield it to empower ourselves.</p>
<ul>
<li>The plumber who wants to code can learn 10x faster with AI tutors.</li>
<li>The politically engaged but time-starved individual can use AI to draft letters, summarize bills, and take action in minutes.</li>
<li>The artist, the activist, the builder — all now have a partner that scales their reach.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether we do this or not, governments and companies are already using it to empower themselves. AI, used wisely, is a tool for liberation. The individual can’t afford to miss this wave of technology.  </p>
<p>We’ve allowed big tech companies to control our time and attention. We need to leverage this technology to reclaim our time, our goals, and our power.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Where to Begin</h2>
<p>You don’t need a master plan. You just need to start.</p>
<ul>
<li>Ask a friend or mentor to help you take the first step.</li>
<li>If no one comes to mind, brainstorm ideas with a chatbot.</li>
<li>And if you still don’t know where to begin, email me — I’ll help.</li>
</ul>
<p>We are not powerless.<br>But if we act like we are, we’re giving our liberty away — scroll by scroll.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Final Thought</h2>
<p>If you want to live a meaningful life — one full of purpose, agency, and joy — then reclaiming your liberty isn’t optional.<br>It’s the first step.</p>
<p>This is how we take back our freedom.<br>This is how we pursue happiness.<br>And this is how we maximize human potential — starting with our own.</p>
